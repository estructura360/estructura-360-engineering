# ESTRUCTURA 360 - Construction Engineering Platform

## Overview

ESTRUCTURA 360 is a construction technology (Construtech) web application designed to help construction professionals, builders, and families make informed decisions about structural construction projects. The platform provides tools for calculating materials for slabs and walls, project scheduling, budget estimation, construction logbooks with photo/GPS tracking, and comparative analysis dashboards. The application is built as a Spanish-language platform targeting the Latin American construction market.

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
- **Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript
- **Routing**: Wouter (lightweight React router)
- **State Management**: TanStack React Query for server state
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with shadcn/ui component library (New York style)
- **Forms**: React Hook Form with Zod validation
- **Charts**: Recharts for data visualization
- **Build Tool**: Vite with custom development plugins for Replit

The frontend follows a page-based architecture with shared components:
- Pages located in `client/src/pages/`
- Reusable UI components in `client/src/components/ui/` (shadcn/ui)
- Custom hooks in `client/src/hooks/`
- Path aliases configured: `@/` for client source, `@shared/` for shared code

### Backend Architecture
- **Runtime**: Node.js with Express
- **Language**: TypeScript (ESM modules)
- **API Pattern**: RESTful API with typed routes defined in `shared/routes.ts`
- **Validation**: Zod schemas shared between frontend and backend

The backend uses a storage abstraction pattern (`IStorage` interface) allowing easy switching between database implementations. Routes are registered in `server/routes.ts` with Zod validation for request/response types.

### Data Storage
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM
- **Schema Location**: `shared/schema.ts` (shared between frontend and backend)
- **Migrations**: Drizzle Kit (`npm run db:push`)

Database tables:
- `projects` - Client projects with profit margins and labor costs
- `calculations` - Material calculations (slabs/walls) with specs and results stored as JSONB
- `schedule_tasks` - Gantt-style project scheduling with dependencies
- `construction_logs` - Site logs with notes, photos, and GPS coordinates

## Key Features

### Slab Comparator (SlabComparator component)
Compares Losa Tradicional (10cm) vs Losa Vigueta Bovedilla with polystyrene:

**Material Coefficients (f'c 250 kg/cm² with 2% waste):**
- Cement: 8 bultos (50kg) per m³
- Sand: 0.5415 m³ per m³
- Gravel: 0.646 m³ per m³
- Water: 237.5 liters per m³
- Bucket conversion: 52.63 buckets (19L) per m³

**Vigueta Types (with images):**
- Vigueta de Alma Abierta: Lightweight, easy to handle (factor 1.0)
- Vigueta Pretensada: Heavier, more robust for large spans (factor 1.10)

**Automatic Peralte Selection (based on shortest side):**
- ≤1.9m → Peralte 15 cm
- 1.9m-5m → Peralte 20 cm
- 5m-6m → Peralte 25 cm

**Bovedilla Specifications:**
- Dimensions: 1.22m × 0.63m × 0.12m
- Axis distance: 70cm between viguetas

**Comparison Logic:**
- V&B applies 30% material savings vs traditional slab
- Weight: Traditional 288 kg/m² vs V&B 180 kg/m²
- Time: 60-70% reduction with V&B system (50 m²/day vs 5 m²/day)
- Formwork: 85% savings (eliminates contact formwork)

**Layout Algorithm:**
- Viguetas: Divide longest side by 0.70, round DOWN (e.g., 10/0.7=14.28 → 14 viguetas)
- No viguetas at edges (perimeter chain/wall space)
- Bovedillas: Fill 100% of spaces between viguetas (1.22×0.63m pieces)
- Adjustment pieces: Cut bovedillas to fill remainders (no empty gaps)

**Features:**
- Dimensions input starting at 0
- Support type selector: Muros de Carga vs Trabes de Concreto (+15% vigueta cost)
- Price inputs: Cement, Sand, Gravel, Water, Vigueta, Bovedilla
- Compression layer slider (3-7 cm)
- Comparative materials table with costs
- SVG floor plan: AutoCAD dark style, cyan viguetas, orange bovedillas, adjustment pieces
- Worker slider (1-30) for time estimation
- PDF budget generation with comparison table

### Build System
- **Development**: Vite dev server with HMR, Express backend served alongside
- **Production**: Custom build script (`script/build.ts`) using esbuild for server bundling and Vite for client
- **Output**: `dist/` directory with `index.cjs` (server) and `public/` (client assets)

## External Dependencies

### Database
- PostgreSQL database (connection via `DATABASE_URL` environment variable)
- Drizzle ORM for type-safe database queries
- `connect-pg-simple` for session storage (configured but sessions not fully implemented)

### Third-Party Services
